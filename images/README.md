Add a 128x128 PNG icon named `icon.png` here to be used as the extension icon shown in the VS Code Marketplace.

Recommended:

- `images/icon.png` — 128x128 PNG
- Optional preview images: `images/preview-1.png`, `images/preview-2.png` (for the Marketplace gallery)

If you don't add an icon, the package will still work but the Marketplace will show a default placeholder.
